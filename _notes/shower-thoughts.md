The path you are meant to take you will have to fight to create. The stars will never align. We have this idea that one day we’re going to do it, follow the dream, start the business - that never happens. Start now.

Ask people and ask the world how you can help, the most successful people are the most selfless, they view life from the lens of others, not themselves. Instead of asking, “how can I make a million dollars?” ask “how can I help other people make millions of dollars, how can I build a platform that helps other people make millions?” How can you serve? Life is about growth and giving.
