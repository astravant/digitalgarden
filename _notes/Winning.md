Obsession, winning, and balance do not belong in the same sentence. There is nothing normal or typical about the lifestyle of a real winner.  You are exhausted and impatient and on the edge all the time, even when you rest. Winning wants all of your time and attention. There is no balance for those who want to win. Stop looking for it, and stop feeling guilty about your lack of it. 

Winning wants all of you. It demands obsession. ==The whole work-life balance thing doesn’t really mean a lot to people who badly want to win.== When you are obsessed with achieving greatness in one area, that usually comes at the expense of most of the things everyone considers normal and healthy. Being the best requires hard sacrifices, and it is never going to be easy. There is no perfect future where you can have greatness in your field, and a great family life, and great holidays, and loads of sleep, and loads of friends. 

Winning doesn’t care if you dont have time. Winning expects you to make time. If you’ve only got so much time to achieve what you want to achieve, all you can do is choose what you focus on. If you want to win that badly, all of your focus should be spent doing what it takes to win. 

Truly confident people cannot be broken. They have been beaten down and broken over and over by life and their goals, and they have ploughed through every obstacle that life has thrown at them.

> “Winning has a price, and that price is that your mind must be stronger than your feelings." - Tim Grover

“Long term goals are great, but long term isn’t promised to anyone. Your skills have and energies have an expiration date. If you want something, go get it now.”

Every day, your time grows shorter. The writer’s message is simple: Do everything. Experience everything you want. Go and achieve your goal. Do not settle or slow or pace yourself. Push. Life is a daily campaign against laziness and the urge to quit. 

if you do what everyone else is doing, you will end up like everyone else.

Extreme people get extreme results.
