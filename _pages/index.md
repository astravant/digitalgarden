# Welcome 🌱

<img src="/assets/digital-garden_web.jpg"/>

Welcome to a digital garden! This is my collection of imperfect notes, essays, and ideas growing slowly over time. A multi-year project of information sensemaking. Generally speaking, this virtual space will discuss thoughts on startups, technology, philosophy, and productivity. It will use bi-directional linking - a lot of internal links - to connect notes together. Feel free to connect with me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/brandonspiess) 👋

The best way to get started on understanding digital gardens is to read this [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/).
