# Welcome ðŸŒ±

Welcome to a digital garden! This is my collection of imperfect notes, essays, and ideas growing slowly over time: a multi-year project of information sensemaking. Generally speaking, this virtual space will share thoughts on entrepreneurship, history, philosophy, startups, and technology. It will use bi-directional linking - a lot of internal links - to connect notes together. Feel free to connect with me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/brandonspiess) ðŸ‘‹
